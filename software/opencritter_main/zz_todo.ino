// BATTERY CHANGES
// Divide IOPU clock by 8 to save power
// Connect buttons to interupt on iopu and code in a sleep mode
// Create a sleep mode for ESP and link to iopu wake
// Add a Battery meter (With ws2812/dual color LED to show battery power as color?)

// MODULE IDEAS
// RTC that automatically corrects your clock offset. locks out clock adjustment and enables critter sleeping overnight?
// If mod bus has raw battery connection, add a battery power meter.
// Special case that shows critter params via ws2812's or a second oled
// NFC reader
// SD car reader?

// HACKS
// Move heart pin to PWM
// Use a WS2812 as a heart led. Displays power by color
