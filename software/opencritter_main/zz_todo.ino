// Connect c button to D2 (interupt 0) for IOPU sleep
// Program OLED to turn on when an ALERT event has happened recently
// Add alert light to IOPU
// Make weight loss / bonuses every second or third catch in ball catch
// change parameters as per comments
// fix shansy animations
// add highscores to each game
// w/o bio kit, show four hearts for power/health. 1 bio kit show bars. 2 bio kits show values
// 1 pedia show up to current lifestage. 2 pedia show all stages. (maybe 3 pedia gives the playergui guides to the breed they want?)
// 1 pedia shows a menu of bars that show how close to each keyframe you are. 2 pedia shows a list of memory addresses
// Figure out how to print char strings to OLED
// Add stasis cell to put critter to "sleep" overnight
// Add score/stat changes screen at end of each game
// Add an engine for multiple animations at once
// Lab Kit item shows labels and values in hex
// Wish item allows you to change any one byte in the game

// Make some code to flip graphics horizontally.

// Greatly expand debug menu capabilities

// DevKit1 Classico


// BATTERY CHANGES
// Divide IOPU clock by 8 to save power
// Connect buttons to interupt on iopu and code in a sleep mode
// Create a sleep mode for ESP and link to iopu wake
// Add a Battery meter (With ws2812/dual color LED to show battery power as color?)

// MODULE IDEAS
// RTC that automatically corrects your clock offset. locks out clock adjustment and enables critter sleeping overnight?
// If mod bus has raw battery connection, add a battery power meter.
// Special case that shows critter params via ws2812's or a second oled
// NFC reader
// SD car reader?

// HACKS
// Move heart pin to PWM
// Use a WS2812 as a heart led. Displays power by color
