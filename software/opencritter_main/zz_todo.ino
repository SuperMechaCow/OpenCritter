// Add a Battery meter (With ws2812/dual color LED to show battery power as color?)

// MODULE IDEAS
// RTC that automatically corrects your clock offset. locks out clock adjustment and enables critter sleeping overnight?
// If mod bus has raw battery connection, add a battery power meter.
// Special case that shows critter params via ws2812's or a second oled
